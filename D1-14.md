### Feedback

#### Product
Clear description of what the application is, and how the application will be developed. 
User stories have captured the most important features. 
However, the acceptance criteria are used to describe the details of a feature. Acceptance criteria should be used to describe how those feature-details will be accepted


### Process
I would have liked to see more "coding-related" task division as well as "group-related" tasks, but it is ok. 
All the other questions were answered well, but have room for more in-depth details. 
Share your trello board.


### Overall Quality
"This web app with save time". 
The first sentence of the deliverable is a non-sentence. 
"Other tools for landlords focused on facilitating tenant screening"
