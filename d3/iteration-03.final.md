# Law and Design - Team 9

## Iteration 3

 * Start date: Nov 18th 2019
 * End date: Dec 2nd 2019

### Changes from `product.md`


### User accounts and multiple leases per account

We decided to remove the ability to create a persistent user account along with the feature of being able to save an in progress lease to your account and have multiple leases on your account for later use.
We had to reduce our scope as we ran into more technical challenges than we thought would happen. We had to remove non essential features to be able to meet the MVP by the end of the project timeline.
We chose to cut this feature as opposed to something else as without this feature a lease can still be made however it needs to be made in one go without closing the page. This was a tradeoff we were willing to make in order to be able to make this lease PDF at all

### Calendar timeline view

Originally we were going to show a calendar/list of all the important dates such as move in, rent due, last notice to increase rent, but none of us knew how to make this on the front end.
This was decided as a “nice to have” feature since it would require someone on the team learning how to make this possible and spending some amount of time working on it. Instead we could have made 2 essential pages in the meantime. We chose the second approach.



### Handoff plan

The Law and Design team will have as much access to the code base, the hosting, and the database as we do currently. They have been added as an admin account on the services we are using, namely Heroku and mongoDB Atlas. Our partners have also had access to GitHub throughout the term, which means they’ve had a chance to oversee all our operations and development. The Law and Design team asked access to GitHub because were technically capable of doing so, and have been successfully running the web application locally themselves. In the case that they won’t have access to the organization repo anymore, we have told our partners to fork the current repository into their own accounts after our demo (Dec 2nd)

We will be giving over all artifacts as well. Our artifacts can all be found on GitHub as well under issues and project tabs. These will be given over completely as is; a snapshot of our current progress and workflow at the moment we stopped working on it.

They will gain access to everything we had access to and used as part of our development process

We chose this because we believe they will continue to work on this in the future and we want to set then up as best we can for them to continue directly from where we left off with as little friction as possible with having to deal with our legacy code.
We want to give them a clear plan of what needs to be done in the near future, as well as long term goals.
We want the partner to be able to bring this to investor and then into production as quickly as possible after this class has ended. They have much more invested into this project than we do and we want to make sure they get return on this investment.

Our partner has worked with developers in the past to create similar projects. We trust their experience and skills will suffice to continue to have the app hosted as is.

We have carefully crafted our README for our partners to be able to take this app and work on it locally or pass it off onto another development instead to continue where we left off. We have laid out our code structure and how to build the app locally as well as how the app is currently being deployed on the readme for a general understanding of the product as a whole. Additionally, we've had an extensive review process for all our changes, which means our code should be in a clean state, and anyone who takes over would be able to understand the codebase without much effort, including getting setup, running the application and any further development. (All guides are included in the README)
We hope the partner continues to work on this and finally bring it to market.
