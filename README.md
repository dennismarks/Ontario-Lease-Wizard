### User Interactions

#### Guest

**NOTE**: As of the time of writing, the back-end is not initialized and deployed. As well as some front-end pages in order to fully use the application

As a guest user, you are able to complete the forms but **without** any saving features.

#### Landlord

**WIP** As a landlord user, you have the ability to create multiple leases for multiple tenants.

#### Tenants

**WIP** As a tenant user, you have the ability to save your progress with the forms online, so it is easy to pick it up afterwards.

## Motivation

- In Ontarioâ€™s highly regulated residential rental markets, landlords must comply with complex rules that are confusing to landlords and tenants alike. A well-drafted lease is one of the most important tools a landlord has to protect their investment and promote a positive relationship with their tenants.

- Unfortunately, the vast majority of leases are long documents written in legalese that:
  - Leave people confused or misinformed about their legal rights and obligations
  - Contain terms that parties never read, are ambiguous, or may not comply with the law
  - Leave people feeling vulnerable and upset increasing the risk of conflict
