 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Nov 11th 2019
 * Where: Google Hangouts

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


1. Requiring pull requests and 2 accepts before adding to master

  When working in pairs  with someone you know, you can feasibly hold each other accountable with what gets pushed to master. With this many people that don't know each other at a personal level we need to ensure quality of code in a formal way. This decision allowed us to catch many things the original code author didn't see as well to make sure we aren't staying consistent as possible. Other team members with more experiene with react pointed out more cannonical react-style ways of implemented features and showing us easier solutions in general. While this takes time to review and accept it overall added a ton of value for us in terms of how we work as a team together.

2. Having the partner on Slack

  This allows us to have a better ad-hoc back and forth without requiring emails or scheduling a video call. This increased paced of communication mid sprint allows us to stay on task and ask for clarification when needed. 


3. Having meetings in person

  We found google hangouts calls are good for quick updates but when decisions that requirement team opinions and discussion nothing beats in person meetings for us. When we have to decide what we are working on the next spring and decide what are the most important tasks we all have slightly different opinions of what we need to make up our MVP. It's easier to specifically refer to people in person and read body language overall. When proposing an opinion often times the unsaid reactions speak more than the verbal reactions.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

1. Using Slack

  We envisioned  ourselves having these perfectly on tasks and seperate conversations occuring in our Slack workspace. The reality is that conversatoins are messier, cross topics quickly, and in general are too multi-disciplinary to be neatly placed into these slack channels we set up. Almost immediately after starting to write software, the slack was bombarded with mundane updates about issues being added, people being assigned to tasks, every time a PR has a comment added, and overall become much too messy to use for any kind of real work. The slack is only used for communicating with the partner is a less formal, and quicker way, than email

2. Using Trello

  We were hoping to use Trello to be able to see where everyone is at during a sprint and seeing what lanes each task in it. We had it all set up to start and then never used it again. We didn't find it useful enough to use and keep updated. The overhead required for keeping up and updating all these tasks greatly exceeds the benefits realized by this system

 

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

1. GitHub issues/projects instead of Trello

  Having all of the workflow occur in the same space was better than splitting it over multiple tools. Being able to quickly see what issue a PR is solving on the same site is much easier than between tabs and comparing different formats and labels. Having everything linked to one GitHub account instead of a GitHub and a Trello account makes managing everything you're assigned to easier.

2. Facebook messenger instead of Slack for team communication

  While many slack features beat out the facebook counterparts (multiple channels, notifying the entire channel, replying in seperate threads to name a few) the quick response and casual nature of messenger makes intra-group communication easier. We will use slack for formal communications/reminders about deadlines, planning in person meetings for the team, and for video calls with the partner. Overall we have mostly entirely switched to messenger for things that require quick or casual replies.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

#### How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
