## Iteration 3

 * Start date: Nov 11th 2019
 * End date: Nov 22nd 2019

## Process

**What's new?**
We have switched from Trello cards to GitHub issues. We organized times where multiple team members work in the same space together to better facility communication and bounce ideas off each other. We are using Facebook messenger for less formal and quicker communication in the team.

### Roles & responsibilities

**Mark** - Partner liaison

- Acts as the link between the technical team and the stakeholder
- Clearly communicate requirements to team and estimations to partner
- I will probably be working on backend mostly and some frontend depending on the Trello tasks need to be done and what I feel I is reasonable for me in scope

**Strengths:**

- I have experience working with relational databases
- Experienced with python, however am new to the libraries we will be using
- I'm very excited to begin working on my first software engineering project

**Weaknesses:**

- I'm relatively new to front end however, I'm currently in 3 courses related to JavaScript/React and functional programming so I expect myself to pick it up quickly
- I need to improve upon my testing skills and want to new strategies for useful testing
- Time  Management - I tend to take on large tasks which is difficult with a large course load, and although im usually able to pull through it leaves me with little personal time in my day 
------
**Demetre** - Internal communication lead (Slack babysitter)

- Organizing the Slack workspace through channels and app integration
	- The issues and PRs can be seen in the specific channels
	- Can reference and reply to these messages for clear communication
- Making sure group is informed of expectations and deadlines
	- There should be no gap of knowledge in the team
- Guide meeting discussion to hit all our topics while still being concise; efficient meetings
	- We are all busy people in the team and we want to make sure we don’t need more meetings than needed
- Allowing the group to be greater than the sum of its parts through open communication
	- Making sure nobody is blocking someone else, nobody is waiting for something that isn’t going to happen etc.
	
**Strengths:**

- Loves testing and testing more testing
	- I am well versed in mocking backend objects as well as front end testing frameworks such as espresso for Android and Jest for React
- Optimizing to the last drop, sometimes too much so
	- I am very focused on doing things quickly
- Well versed in functional programming concepts to solve more niche problems
	- I bring a different view on tackling problems especially since we are using  javascript which is at heart a functional programming language
	
**Weaknesses:**

- Stays too focuses on minute details, ie. can't see the forest the trees
	- I box myself into a problem without being able to zoom out and see the bigger picture, this hurts me by not being able to see how my part fits in with others part of the code or see a solution that isn’t immediately for what
- Overloading myself by taking on too large of a part
	- I am bad at estimating how much time things will take and it has caused me issues in the past (and probably in the future too)
- No experience with databases or working in groups this big
	- Need to really try to catch up with the essentials as other team members do have this kind of essential experience

## Team Rules

Describe your team's working culture.

**Communications:**
- The team agreed on a tentative response time of 24h. That all concerns and ideas should be addressed within that time frame. We have 3 channels of communications: 
	- Facebook’s Messenger group chat, which is for urgent discussions, since not everyone is on top of Slack on a daily basis due to their work; 
	- Slack channels, for general discussions, planning and partner’s communications;
	- Github PR/Issues, for code specifics in order to streamline the review process.
 
**Meetings:**
- For most team meetings, it is expected that everyone to show up, either physically or through group calls. As it’s when we have our retrospective discussion on the previous sprint and the status of each member. And a meeting would only be facilitated if and only if at least 5 people are avaliable.
- If someone is not present, they need to reach out to members, whom attended to get a rundown of their tasks and expectations. 
- Often times, it will be the members whom has most recently in contact with the partners to facilitate the meeting for they are most updated with Partner’s expectations. Generally it would be Amir (Tech Lead), Mark (Partner liaison) and Max (Facilitator).


**Conflict Resolution:**
1. Dominant personality

- Some members have pointed out that some members have, unintentionally, "carried" the decision making process. We plan to have an equal voice between all members, for all ideas are valued in our team. All decisions will be decided by the major consensus.

2. Communication delays

- Since most of the team members are taking on heavy workload at school, communication might sometimes be a bit delayed. Fortunately each member is either the same classes/projects outside of 301 or has a longtime partnership with each other so most communication can be relayed through personal contacts.

3. Analysis Paralysis

- We also had a problem where we weren't sure which tech stack to follow through. Our solution is to designate members to do research on each stack and present their findings at the next meeting so we can all decisively go with the best solution for the team and for our partners.


## Events

**Meetings**
- We have beginning sprint meetings where the people who met with partner talk about what the partner prioritized for the next sprint and we as a team break that down into individual tasks that we add to github and assign for the sprint.
- We have popup work sessions where we work on similar tasks together. These are ad-hoc as we deem them necessary. For example, last sprint we were all making front end pages and we decided to get together to make sure we could help each other for common issues
- We have decided we don’t need code review sessions as we are requiring 2 accepts for each PRs so we are confident our code quality will stay high quality and consistent. 
- Meetings are moderated by Demetre based on the purpose of the meeting. We think this ensures that each meeting at the minimum meets the goal of why it was called. He also takes meeting minutes for the group to reference.
- We have sprint planning meetings where we decide what are the must-haves for that sprint and what are extend goals based on the feedback we get from the partner after their weekend code review.  We prioritize tasks and user stories tied directly to the core functionality of MVP. For us this is inputting required information and then creating the lease PDF. We aren’t focusing on things such as log in, multiple leases, saving progress mid lease creation for example.
- We have quick sprint review sessions mostly for us to realign ourselves and aid us in making better time estimates. We found getting up to speed took longer than we expected it to for example. These meetings include going over what worked and what didn’t and if we need to hold more meetings, less meetings, if we have things we need clarification from partner.

**Overall:**
We decided we want to keep our amounts of meeting small and efficient. Many team members have difficult schedules and other shifting priorities week to week and we don’t want to be spending time in meeting when we could be spending time actually creating our product. This is why we only have planning meetings and partner meetings as our regularly scheduled meetings. 


#### Partner Meetings
You must have at least 2 meetings with your project partner - an initial planning meeting discussing the features you will build this iteration and a sprint demo meeting to review what you've done. Describe the meetings here:
* When and where will you meet?
* What do you intend to discuss(**note you will have meeting minutes in the review document**)?

**First meeting**: Tuesday the 12th, 11AM
- The meeting will be conducted through Google Hangouts for easy connection. 
- The goal of the meeting is to inform the partners about the sprint plan and the stable build. As well as informing them about their ability to add feedbacks to the repository. We hope to align our goal with theirs as well as hearing feedbacks about the quality of work from the last sprint.

**Second meeting**: Saturday the 23rd, TBA
- The meeting will be conducted through Google Hangouts.
- The goal of the meeting is to demo the product to the partners, as well as getting feedbacks. We hope to be able to demonstrate the backend integrated with React by the end of the sprint. So our family of feedbacks in focus would be how well the application works given assumed parameters.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

**Organization tools:**
We have switched from using Trello to using GitHub issues and projects to keep all of our necessary artifacts and organization on a single medium. Issues are opened and assigned based on that sprints organization meeting which is described elsewhere. We chose to switch to GitHub issues instead of Trello since we can see our entire workflow together instead of split across 2 different websites. It also ties directly to our GitHub accounts instead of requiring Trello accounts as well, this means we have less overhead for working together

## Deployment and Github Workflow

**Workflow:**
We are all considered admins in our team’s GitHub repository for the sake of simplicity. This allows any single person to merge un-reviewed branches, close any issue, and assign issues to anyone. While we acknowledge this is dangerous, it makes collaboration easier as nobody on this team is a true “team manager/product manager” as we all share that responsibility. Having everyone as admin allows each person on the team to act as a product manager when required. We are working with a system built on common respect and trust to ensure nobody abuses these permissions, for example, by merging un-reviewed PRs. 

**Branching strategy:**
For each issue we take on (in GitHub issues), we create a branch. We name our branches to match the name of the issue for easily knowing what the branch should do. The branch can be a feature branch, refactoring legacy code, bug fixing, or whatever else this issue entails, but this makes it easy to review the PR and compare to the issue and make sure all the specs were met before approval. We chose this strategy to ensure that each branch should do one thing and only one thing, we want to avoid having one branch be too far-reaching in terms of what it aims to contain. We believe in the “branch early and branch often” philosophy of using git. We know this can result in having many merge issues but we aim to avoid this by separating our tasks/issues in a way that avoids having 2 people work on the same part of the code base at the same time, instead we chose to have 1 person work on the same part of the code base in sequence instead of 2 people in parallel. We can also mitigate merge conflict issues by pulling and merging often. 

We branch only off of master for each issue. The issues are small enough and self contained where we don’t need to have people branch from not master. This is to reduce complexity of merges and to keep our git as simple as possible, nobody wants to deal with complex merges and branch issues. 

**Submitting a PR:**
When a teammate has finished implementing their code to address an issue, they submit a pull request with details about their design decisions for that issue, if they chose react class components, functional components etc. The route needed to access that page if applicable, i.e /rent or /deposits. What modules they installed and a description of what that module does. If they needed to create a new generic component to be used in other pages, ex We have a common tooltip/extra information component we use.

We only submit PRs for issue branches to master

**Reviewing PRs:**
Everyone is responsible for reviewing PRs. All teammates are invited to review on github and will receive updates by email if they have opted into this option and on the slack channel by default that a PR is ready to review. Comments from reviews include asking for clarification on a certain implementation choice, reminders to use components we have already made for consistency across pages, following naming conventions.

**Accepting PRs:**
A PR needs to be accepted by at least 2 team members before it can be squashed and merged. We use squash and merge to keep the history simple and easy to understand, if we ever need to dig deep into the commits before squashing we can reopen the PR and review again.
For a PR to be accepted it needs to meet the functional criteria of the issue, it needs to follow our decided conventions for naming, using class vs functional components, pass our linter (ESLint), and overall follow good coding style. 
We chose 2 people to accept as we didn’t think 1 person was enough, 2 pairs of eyes to look everything over since we are accepting into master and master is sacred. 
3 people would be too many since that’s nearly half our team and we want to spend more time making sure we are adding new features and not just nitpicking over every PR. However, on more important pull requests, as decided by the team, it may make sense for more/all members to have a chance to review the PR and submit any objects/suggestions the might have. We will have 2-3 issues to each person for every sprint and we don’t have to have to require 3 people to review 15-20 PRs every sprint. 

**Overall comments:**
We wanted to use the industry standard tool of GitHub, we want to follow good practices of feature branching, submitting/reviewing/accepting PRs. We want to make sure that nothing gets into production after being looked at by only the original developer. Even if this is simply “just” a class project we are working with a non profit that has a big stake in this succeeding and we strive to be as professional as possible including internal decisions like our workflow. 

TODO: should we talk about slack in our workflow? Is this strictly about our development workflow?

**Deployment**
We decided to have the main deployment for stable build (demo purposes) on Heroku. Since we are doing PR reviews where the PR needs to have at least 2 approvals, which requires the merging to follow the application’s flow and data handling, the master branch is considered to be the stable version of the application. As that is, the stable build will be continuously deployed when there’s a commit to the master branch. Also since github is integrated with slack, the partners are automatically notified of the new build, ie whenever a PR is approved. 

- Our rationale behind continuous deployment is that since the partners are going to be using that build to check in, it pushes each team members to ensure their, and others, code is up to standard and working as planned. For their immediate feedback can give us more time to reflect and adjust accordingly.


## Product

### Goals:

**Generate a lease pdf**

We would like to implement the functionality to generate the lease document. The user should be able to get the lease document in pdf form when requesting it in the front end. The document should be generated from the information in the database provided by the user.

Tasks: 
Implement a Python function that generates a pdf based on the lease template and the information in the database (once the database is set up)

**Send information from front end to back end**

We would like to implement functionality to send form data from the front end to the back end and store the data in a database. 

Tasks: 
Implement a Javascript function to submit data from each page
Setup a MySql database + schema
Implement a Flask route to receive data in the back end and insert into the database

**Add more front end pages**

We would like to implement some more pages for the front end during this iteration as well. 

Tasks:
Implement the timeline pages React components (‘Timeline’ and ‘Questions and Answers’ subpages)

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.

Both our old Trello board and GitHub Projects board consist of the following columns:

1. To-Do: Tasks that are planned for the current sprint, but have not been started yet
2. In Progress: Tasks that have been picked up by someone and are currently in progress
3. In Review: Tasks that have been completed by the author and have a corresponding pull request for them. At this point, at least 2 reviewers must look at the code to ensure code quality. For tasks not involving code, a PR needs to be created so that it can go under the same review process. E.g. Research best db solution, choice of DatePicker, Docker vs Local, etc. 
4. Done: PR has been merged into master, or the team has reached a consensus if it does not involve code. 

We have chosen this workflow as it’s easy to see what tasks are planned for the sprint, and what the status of each task is, and whether or not a particular task needs attention (help for implementation of needs reviewers)

We create a new GitHub Project every sprint, and move any tasks that needed to be completed but were not to the new board. In our planning meeting, held after our partner meeting towards the end of the sprint, which we plan ad-hoc for the weekend based on people’s availabilities, we discuss input from the partners and decide what needs to be done on this sprint at a high level. As we have just shown a demo of our current work to the partners, we should have enough information and feedback if any modifications need to be done, and what we should prioritize for the upcoming sprint. 

After this meeting, a team member (Amir/Demetre/Max/volunteer decided during the call) will take all the tasks and create issues for them on Github if one doesn’t already exist with detailed specifications and requirements. This does not mean it has to be as detailed as a perfect user story/requirements, but should still capture all the important details and remove any ambiguity. This flexible path allows the developer to be creative during the task and raise up any details/blockers once they’ve had a chance to look into the task in more detail. Of course, if a huge blocker/difficulty is flagged on the task, the team has to be updated in order to decide accordingly (push out other tasks/meeting to discuss/assign more people). 

And lastly, once the tasks have been added to the board and the sprint officially starts (Monday Morning), members can assign tasks(1-2) for themselves based on their preferences/expertise, while making sure a good balance of workload is spread throughout the team members. Goal of this free-for-all assignment is for all members to get exposure to different kinds of development (front-end/back-end/research), delivering an enriched software engineering workflow.  

Reviewers and the code author are responsible for making sure the PR meets the requirements set out in the issue, and follows acceptable coding style/standards. It is the responsibility of the code author to get the PR approved and merged, which requires them to chase after approvals and addressing PR issues in a timely manner.
